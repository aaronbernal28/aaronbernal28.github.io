### Internet auction in US Schools
This project is an implementation in Python of the model from the paper [An asymmetric multi-item auction with quantity discounts applied to Internet service procurement in Buenos Aires public schools](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-016-2164-x), which focuses on linear programming. Since the actual $91,063$ schools are provided in the US, we created six fictional firms for educational purposes, along with their respective discount and unit prices.
